### Nutrikit

Nutrikit is a full stack application that allows users to track their macronutrients and total calories

Add foods to the menu and see your total calories and macronutrients consumed. Vview the nutritional data for each individual food as well as edit and add new foods. 

I have new features coming soon to this project.

React, PostgreSQL, Flask-Restful, Reactstrap, Python, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3
